# Aeolus-NixOS
This repository exists largely for me and me only, and is on github for convenience, however all of my dotfiles are here for manual installation if you want. I sincerely dont recommend anyone actually use this in its current state due to simply how unpolished it is

**PREFACE**

I did not assemble anything myself, this is entirely made out of pre-existing parts, and assembling one of these is far more impressive than anything I have done here. Please, make sure to use proper credit and check out everything that made this possible.

Further credit goes to my friend liassica for helping me on my nixOS journey so far - make sure to read her nixOS config, it was a very useful tool for me. https://codeberg.org/liassica/nixos-config

Finally, this setup is quite buggy. Use at your own risk.
